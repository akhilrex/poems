## A Morning Reflection

In the stillness before the world wakes,
The sky blushes with anticipation,
Soft hues of amber and rose
Paint across the awakening canvas.

The birds begin their gentle chorus,
Nature's timeless refrain,
Each voice a note in the symphony
Of another day beginning.

In these moments, we find ourselves—
Stripped of yesterday's worries,
Unburdened by tomorrow's weight,
Present in the simplicity of now.

The morning asks no questions,
Makes no demands,
Only invites us to breathe,
To witness, and to be.
