My baby girl asked me today
How did you learn to be a dad?
I look up to my father
for the few things he got right
Then I look at all the holes in me
that I must not leave in you
I wish there was a school for this
where I could have enrolled when you were born
For now all I can do is try
Hoping I have a better run
