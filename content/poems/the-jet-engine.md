description: "Where is my manual?"

This young friend had a question
How tough is it to be a father.
Is it as hard as it seems from outside
or does it ever get better
I smiled - less at their naivete

to think how I can put into words
What seems like a jet engine
that you have to build with hands
with no manual or blueprint
and still hope that it flies.
